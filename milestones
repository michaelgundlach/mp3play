Where I'd like the package to be, per version number.

0.2: Windows API fleshed out
0.3: Windows API complete
0.4: Mac or Linux added, as complete as Windows in 0.2
0.5: Mac or Linux complete
0.6: Final OS added, as in 0.4
0.7: Final OS complete
1.0: All APIs complete

This plan might get shot to heck, but it's a nice road to try to follow.

Eventually:

rename to audioplay and deprecate mp3play.  As it can play other stuff too,
WAVs at least.  I should only limit it to those files that can be made to play
on all 3 systems, though, so that code that uses this module will Just Work.

Also, pyglet seems to do all this does and more.  However, it requires AVLib
and is a heavier download, so for Windows at least mp3play seems to have
something going for it.  If I can't get Linux and/or Mac to work without
using AVLib, though, then I'm no better off than pyglet!
